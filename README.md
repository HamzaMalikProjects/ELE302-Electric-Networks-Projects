# ⚡ ELE302 – Electric Networks Projects

**Course:** ELE302 – Electric Networks  
**Institution:** Toronto Metropolitan University  
**Focus:** Op-Amps, Filters, Mutual Inductance, Second-Order Systems, Frequency Response  

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains pre-lab and post-lab reports from ELE302 – a core electrical engineering course focused on advanced circuit analysis and experimental validation. Labs investigate the behavior of electric networks, emphasizing the practical application of theoretical concepts including operational amplifiers, resonance, filtering, and coupled inductors.

Each lab builds proficiency in using measurement equipment, applying circuit laws, and interpreting dynamic system behavior using Bode plots and transient analysis.

## 🧪 Lab Summary

- **Lab 1 – Operational Amplifier Circuit Configuration**  
  Explored inverting, non-inverting, integrator, and differentiator op-amp circuits.

- **Lab 2 – Second-Order Circuits**  
  Analyzed transient and steady-state response in underdamped/overdamped RLC circuits.

- **Lab 3 – Frequency Response & Bode Plots**  
  Measured magnitude and phase plots; identified cutoff frequencies and resonances.

- **Lab 4 – Filters**  
  Designed and tested active and passive filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass).

- **Lab 5 – Mutual Inductance**  
  Investigated coupled inductors, dot convention, and mutual coupling effects.
